The CircleCI Config SDK
 is a JavaScript package library (also compatible with TypeScript) for generating a CircleCI YAML configuration file. Use the SDK to:

Replace writing YAML configuration files

Generate a static YAML configuration file

Modularize and manage your configuration as JavaScript packages

Enhance CircleCIâ€™s dynamic configuration

Build integrations with CLI tools or browser-based experiences

For example, generating a static configuration file can be useful for CLI tools where you want to create a CircleCI configuration, or browser-based tooling, such as a visual config editor
.

Components created with the CircleCI Config SDK can be packaged and distributed as Node packages.

Install the SDK
Install the CircleCI Config SDK with NPM or Yarn, and include it in your project via Node.js or the browser.

NPM installation: $ npm i @circleci/circleci-config-sdk
